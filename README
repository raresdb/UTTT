This is the implementation of a few UTTT(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe)
strategies.

* dummy strategy first: always chooses the first move possible in natural order of the moves:
[nw,n,ne,w,c,e,..]. This applies first to the board position, and then the position in the board.

* dummy strategy last: same but in reverse order of the available positions

* narrow greedy: will use priorities. First choose the board with the least priority, followd by the
position with the least priority:

Priorities:
0: winner moves for that board
1: moves that block the enemy from winning that board(moves that if the enemy choose, will bring
them a win)
2: when the board is empty, corners have this priority
3: if the current player made no move and the enemy already marked the center, corners have this
priority
3: same but for center if the enemy didnt move there yet
4: moves that lead the the current player being able to win in one more move afterwards
5: if the others dont apply, then moves in the corners get this priority
6: any other case has this priority

* greedy: analyses all boards for next moves

Priorities in order:
- winner moves
- moves that force the oponent to make a move in a board where they havent moved yet
- moves that force the oponent to make a move in a board where they moved only once
- moves that force the oponent to make a move in a board where they moved at least twice, firstly
choosing the boards where the current player has done more moves
- moves that no rule apply to, including the ones below
- moves that lead the oponent to a board where the current player is about to win
- moves that lead to oponent to a board where the oponent can win in one move, but that move will
lead the current player to a board where they are about to win in one move or the board is already
finished
- same, but in this case the current player is not about to win the board where that move will lead
them to
- moves that lead the oponent in an already finished board
- moves that lead the oponent to a board where they can win the whole game in a move

If 2 moves get the same priority, the order will be the natural order of the moves [nw,n,ne,..].
